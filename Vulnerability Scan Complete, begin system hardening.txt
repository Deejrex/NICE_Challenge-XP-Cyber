1. I logged into Workstation-Desk VM, then I opened File explorer then clicked on Flashdrive(E:), then opened output to view the Nessus file scan output.

2. On Dev-Web, it had a critical vulnerability to Shellshock. I booted up Dev-Web VM and ran the command "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade bash". That fixed the vulnerability.

3. On Mail, it had an outdated PHP version. I ran the "php -v" command and found it uses PHP 7.2.5. Then I ran the "cat /proc/version" command to see which disto of linux I'm using. It is SUSE. Then I entered the command "sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper update". After that I needed to update the PHP repositories which I did by using command "sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:php/openSUSE_Leap_15.5/devel:languages:php.repo" command. Then I refreshed the repository again, "sudo zypper refresh". Then finally installed a new version of PHP with "sudo zypper install php8 php8-mysql php8-gd php8-mbstring php8-xml" then followed the prompts. Then I did a reboot of the server, "sudo reboot".

4. On Backup, it is vulnerable to the vsftpd Smiley Face Backdoor. I logged into the server and ran the command "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vsftpd" to fix the issue.

5. On Prod-Web, there is a AlmaLinux 9: curl vulnerability. This was resolved by first running the following commands: "sudo yum install samba", "sudo yum update samba" then "sudo dnf upgrade" followed by "sudo reboot". This also fixes the SSH vulnerablilities.

6. On Dev-Web, I first ran the command "sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config", then I modified the MACs line to "MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com". Then I ran the command "sudo systemctl restart sshd" to restart the ssh service. This fixed the ssh vulnerabilities. I repeated the same process for Mail, Fileshare and Backup VMs.
